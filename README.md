## Description

The Gold Multiply Funds EA is designed to automate trading in the gold market. It aims to generate a target profit of $100,000 from an initial investment of $210. The EA uses a compounding strategy to increase lot size based on the account balance.

## Global Variables

- `initialInvestment`: The initial investment amount ($210).
- `profitTarget`: The target profit amount ($100,000).
- `compoundingBalanceThreshold`: The balance threshold for compounding (70).
- `lotSize`: The initial lot size (0.01).

## Custom Functions

### `CalculateLotSize(double balance)`

This function calculates the lot size based on the current account balance and the compounding balance threshold. The lot size is determined by dividing the balance by the compounding balance threshold and multiplying it by the initial lot size.

### `IsTargetProfitReached(double balance)`

This function checks if the target profit has been reached by comparing the balance minus the initial investment with the profit target. It returns `true` if the target profit has been reached, and `false` otherwise.

### `Buy(double lotSize)` and `Sell(double lotSize)`

These functions execute buy and sell orders, respectively. The actual code to execute the orders should be added in the placeholders.

### `AnalyzeMarket()`

This function analyzes the market and makes investment decisions based on the analysis. The actual code for market analysis and investment decisions should be added in the placeholders.

### `Trade()`

This function implements the trading logic by checking the current balance, calculating the lot size, and making investment decisions based on market analysis. It only trades if the current balance is greater than or equal to the initial investment and the calculated lot size is greater than 0.

### `StartTrading()`

This function controls the trading process by continuously calling the `Trade()` function until the target profit is reached. It pauses for 1 second before each trade using the `Sleep()` function.

## Expert Advisor Start Function

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the Expert Advisor. It calls the `StartTrading()` function to begin the trading process.
